💾 **Database Used ∶∶**

MySQL

Database Name: project

Table Name: retail_sales

📘 **Project Overview ∶∶**

This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data using SQL.
The main goal is to perform data cleaning, exploration, and analysis to extract meaningful insights such as:

◉Total sales

◉Customer behavior

◉Category performance

◉Transaction trends

**Using SQL queries, i:**

◉Created a database

◉Cleaned null values

◉Explored data

◉Performed analytical queries

◉Generated business insights

This project helps in understanding real-world data handling and business intelligence using SQL.

🎯 **Project Objectives ∶∶**

◉Create and manage a retail sales database

◉Perform data cleaning to remove null values

◉Explore dataset structure and contents

◉Analyze customer and sales trends

◉Generate insights using SQL aggregate functions

◉Identify top customers and best-performing categories

🏗️ **Project Structure ∶∶**

◉Database Setup

◉Data Cleaning

◉Data Exploration

◉Data Analysis

**Findings & Insights ∶∶**

1️⃣ **Database Setup (With Code) ∶∶**

       sql
       ◉CREATE DATABASE project;

       SHOW DATABASES;

       USE project;

       SELECT * FROM project.retail_sales;

       SELECT * FROM project.retail_sales LIMIT 10;

       SELECT COUNT(*) FROM project.retail_sales;
       


This step:

◉Creates the database

◉Selects the database

◉Checks data inside the table

2️⃣**Data Cleaning ∶∶**

🔍 Checking for NULL Values

       sql
       ◉SELECT *

       FROM project.retail_sales

       WHERE sale_date IS NULL;



       DELETE FROM project.retail_sales

       WHERE transactions_id IS NULL

       OR sale_date IS NULL
   
       OR sale_time IS NULL
   
       OR gender IS NULL
   
        OR category IS NULL
   
       OR quantity IS NULL
   
       OR cogs IS NULL
   
       OR total_sale IS NULL;
       


✅ **Result:**

No NULL values were found in the dataset after cleaning.


3️⃣ **Data Exploration ∶∶**


Basic exploration queries:

       
        sql
       ◉SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_sale 

       FROM retail_sales;
       
       
       SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_customers

       FROM retail_sales;
       
       
       SELECT DISTINCT category 

       FROM retail_sales;
       

4️⃣**Data Analysis (10 Important Questions with Queries) ∶∶**

1. **How many total sales are there?**
   
        sql
       ◉SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_sales

       FROM retail_sales;
       

2.**How many unique customers are there?**

       sql
       ◉SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_customers

       FROM retail_sales;
       

3. **Retrieve all sales on '2022-11-05'**
   
       sql
       ◉SELECT *

       FROM retail_sales

       WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';


4. **Total sales amount for each category**
   
       sql
       ◉SELECT category,

       SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
       
       FROM retail_sales

       GROUP BY category;


5. **Clothing category transactions with quantity > 3 in Nov 2022**
   
       sql
       ◉SELECT *

       FROM retail_sales

       WHERE category = 'Clothing'

         AND quantity > 3
  
         AND sale_date BETWEEN '2022-11-01' AND '2022-11-30';
  

6. **Average age of customers in Beauty category**
    
        sql
        ◉SELECT ROUND(AVG(age),2) AS avg_age

        FROM retail_sales

        WHERE category = 'Beauty';


7. **Transactions where total_sale > 1000**
    
       sql
       ◉SELECT *

       FROM retail_sales

       WHERE total_sale > 1000;


8. **Total transactions by gender in each category**
    
       sql
       ◉SELECT category,

              gender,
       
              COUNT(*) AS total_transactions
       
        FROM retail_sales

        GROUP BY category, gender

        ORDER BY category;


9. **Top 5 customers by highest total sales**
    
         sql
         ◉SELECT customer_id,

          SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
       
          FROM retail_sales

          GROUP BY customer_id

          ORDER BY total_sales DESC

          LIMIT 5;


10. **Unique customers per category**
    
          sql
          ◉SELECT category,

          COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers
       
          FROM retail_sales

          GROUP BY category;


📊 **Data Analysis & Findings ∶∶**

◉After running the above queries, we observed:


◉The dataset contains multiple categories like Clothing, Beauty, etc.


◉Some customers contribute more revenue (Top 5 customers identified).


◉Clothing category shows higher quantity purchases.


◉Sales above 1000 indicate premium transactions.


◉Customer age varies by category preference.


◉Gender-wise category purchases show buying pattern differences.
